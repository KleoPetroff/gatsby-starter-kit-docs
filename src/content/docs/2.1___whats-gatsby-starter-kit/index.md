title: What's Gatsby Starter Kit?
categories: ['general']

**Gatsby Starter Kit** is a set of starters for [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) **v2**, created and maintained by [me](../../about).

There are **five** default starters:

- Minimal
- Equipped
- Themed
- Website
- Blog

Every of the default starters are built on top of the previous one with additional features.

The starters are maintain as separate branches of the same [git repository](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-kit).

Please remember, the **Kit** works only with Gatsby **version 2** which is still in **beta**. I decided to built the Kit for future advisedly.
