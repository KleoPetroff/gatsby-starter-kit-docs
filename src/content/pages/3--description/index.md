This repo contains a series of starters for [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) v2.

The starters are progressively enhanced from the simplest one to the most advanced one.

You can choose between:

- minimal
- addons
- mdposts
- mdpages
- master

All starters deliver an opinionated structure of files and components but no styles at all.

> Please remember that GatsbyJS v2 is still in beta.
